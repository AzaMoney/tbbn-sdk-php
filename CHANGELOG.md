# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added `space->availability($spaceId, $query)`: a Space's bookable slots, each with spots left or why it can't be booked. A booking at a Space with hours and a booking length must start on an `AVAILABLE` slot; otherwise it's refused with `NOT_A_BOOKING_TIME`, `SLOT_FULL`, `SLOT_BLOCKED`, `SLOT_TOO_SOON`, `SLOT_TOO_FAR` or `SLOT_PAST` and `details.nextAvailable`. Added `billing->merchantSummary()`: your Merchant's plan (its Business's) and this period's usage.

- Added `webhooks->updateSubscription($id, $input)`: rename a webhook, move it to a new address or change its events — the signing secret is kept. `createSubscription` takes an optional `name`, your own label for the endpoint. A webhook address must now be public https; deliveries carry `X-TBBN-Webhook-Id` and `X-TBBN-Delivery-Id` headers.

- Added `tradeSessions->records($from, $to)`: your Merchant's trade records for your books — per trade and side, each item's terms as traded, both sides' values, what each trader paid and when (`GET /v1/trade-sessions/records`). Merchant listings no longer need a seller id (`sellerRef` instead, or none for your store's own item).

- `merchants->inviteUser` now sends an invitation the person accepts (they join when they do). Added `merchants->listInvitations`, `merchants->revokeInvitation` and `businesses->listInvitations`.

- Space API test mode: bookings made with a test key (`sk_space_sandbox_`) are now test bookings (`livemode: false`) — never charged, nobody notified; their links open a test page where consent and payment are simulated. No method changes.
- Removed `sandbox.provisionMerchant`: anonymous sandbox keys are gone. Test keys (`sk_sandbox_`) now come from the merchant dashboard in Test mode and work only on the Merchant's test account; a test key made before 2026-10-06 returns 401 `SANDBOX_KEY_RETIRED`. `sandbox.fixtures` is unchanged.
- Added `tradeSessions->declineSpaceProposal($id, $proposalId, $actingSellerId)`.
- Added `merchants->removeUser($id, $userId)` — removes someone from the Merchant team (not the owner).
- Merchant team roles are now `ADMIN`, `DEVELOPER`, `ACCOUNT_MANAGER`, `OPERATIONS`, `ACCOUNTANT`, `SUPPORT` and `VIEWER` for `merchants->inviteUser` and `changeRole`; `OWNER` can't be assigned.
- `tradeSessions->proposeSpace($id, spaceId: ..., acceptTerms: true, scheduledAt: ...)` proposes a Space to meet at; when the other trader accepts, it's booked in your name and you pay for it. A `$branchId` alone still proposes a location only. `acceptSpaceProposal` returns `{ proposal, booking }`, and only the other trader can accept.
- Removed the audit-log resource — the audit trail is no longer part of the public API.
- Added `tradeSessions->extendExternalSettlement($id, $side, $days, $reason)` — extend a matching-only side's report deadline once, by up to 14 days.
- Added `tradeSessions->reportExternalSettlement($id, $side, $outcome, $reason)` — a side whose merchant runs its own checkout reports how it settled (`completed`, or `failed` with a reason).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-29

### Breaking

- Billing is per Business: `billing->getSubscription`, `changeTier`, `cancelSubscription` and
  `usageSummary` take a Business id, and `createSubscription` takes a `businessId`.
- Removed `sellers->requestLinkOtp`, `verifyEmail` and `verifyPhone` — seller linking is
  `sellers->verify` plus the OAuth flow in `oauthLink`.
- `webhooks->disableSubscription($id)` no longer takes a merchant id, and
  `webhooks->listDeliveries($subscriptionId)` requires the subscription id.

### Added

- `businesses`, `branches` (including `bulkUpsert`) and `businessMerchantLinks`.
- `space` — search, Space details, booking terms and bookings (create, list, payment info,
  cancel, reschedule, host cancel).
- `billing`: `changePlan`, `suspension`, `completeCheckout`, `wallet`, `topUp`,
  `usageBreakdown`, `statement`.
- Business (TBBN Space) webhooks on `webhooks`.
- `tradeSessions`: close unreciprocated, confirm/fail scheduling, excuse fulfilment, acknowledge
  hold terms, and Space proposals.
- `oauthClients`, `oauthLink`, `merchantFeed`, `reviews`, `status`, `sellers->createHeadless` and
  `sellers->listForMerchant`.
- `TbbnApiException::$details`.

### Fixed

- Errors carry the API's real message instead of "Unknown error".

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-15

- Removed the `reservations` resource group. Reservations are managed by the platform for the duration of a trade session and are no longer reachable through the public API.
- Added a LICENSE (MIT), this changelog, and a runnable example under `example/`.

## 0.1.0

Initial release — a client for every public resource group of the TBBN Platform API, plus `WebhookVerifier`.
